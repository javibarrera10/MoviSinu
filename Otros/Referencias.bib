   abstract = {This paper presents a global review of the crucial strategic and tactical steps of transit planning: the design and scheduling of the network. These steps influence directly the quality of service through coverage and directness concerns but also the economic profitability of the system since operational costs are highly dependent on the network structure. We first exhibit the context and the goals of strategic and tactical transit planning. We then establish a terminology proposal in order to name sub-problems and thereby structure the review. Then, we propose a classification of 69 approaches dealing with the design, frequencies setting, timetabling of transit lines and their combinations. We provide a descriptive analysis of each work so as to highlight their main characteristics in the frame of a two-fold classification referencing both the problem tackled and the solution method used. Finally, we expose recent context evolutions and identify some trends for future research. This paper aims to contribute to unification of the field and constitutes a useful complement to the few existing reviews. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

To reduce the computational burden, we introduce an iterative algorithm that uses gradient approximations to obtain an approximate dispatching solution. The proposed solution method is found to be significantly faster than exact optimization approaches for quadratic programming and maintains an (almost) negligible optimality gap in realistic bus operation scenarios.

   abstract = {In this paper, we propose and analyze an online, decentralized policy for dispatching vehicles in a multi-line public transit system. In the policy, vehicles arriving at a terminal station are assigned to the lines starting at the station in a round-robin fashion. Departure times are selected to minimize deviations from a certain target headway. We prove that this policy is self-organizing: given that there is a sufficient number of available vehicles, a timetable spontaneously emerges that meets the target headway of every line. Moreover, in case one of the vehicles breaks down, the remaining vehicles automatically redistribute over the network to re-establish such a timetable. We present both theoretical and numerical results on the time until a stable state is reached and on how quickly the system recovers after the breakdown of a vehicle. Experiments on three real-world transit systems show that our policy performs well, even if not all assumptions required for the theoretical analysis are met: if there are enough vehicles, the realized headways are typically close to the target headways. These promising results suggest that our self-organizing policy could be useful in situations where centralized dispatching is impractical or simply impossible due to an abundance of disruptions or the absence of information systems.},

This paper focuses on studying the real-time vehicle scheduling problem, which involves dispatching and controlling different model vehicles uniformly based on generated vehicle number tasks at a given point in time. By considering the immediacy of real-time itinerary tasks, this paper optimizes the vehicle scheduling problem at a single time point. The objective function is to minimize the total operating cost of the system while satisfying constraints such as passenger capacity and vehicle transfer time. To achieve this, a vehicle scheduling optimization model is constructed, and a solution approach is proposed by integrating bipartite graph optimal matching theory and the Kuhn–Munkres algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by comparing it with a traditional greedy algorithm using the same calculation example. The results show that the optimization method has higher solution efficiency and can generate a scheduling scheme that effectively reduces operating costs, improves transportation efficiency, and optimizes the operation organization process for demand-responsive buses.},

   abstract = {Urban public transportation agencies sometimes have to operate mixing vehicles of different sizes on their routes, due to resource limitations or historical reasons. Services with different passenger-carrying capacities are provided to passengers during a mixed-fleet operation. A fundamental question arising here is how to optimally deploy a given fleet of different bus sizes to provide services that minimize passenger waiting time. We formulate a mixed-fleet vehicle dispatching problem as a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) model to optimize dispatching schemes (dispatching orders and times) when a given set of buses of different sizes are available to serve demand along a route. The objective is to minimize the average passenger waiting time under time-dependent demand volumes. Stochastic travel times between stops and vehicle capacity constraints (i.e., introducing extra waiting time due to denied boarding) are explicitly modeled. A Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm coupled with a Monte Carlo simulation framework is developed to solve large real-world instances in the presence of stochastic travel times. Results show that, in addition to dispatching headway, bus dispatching sequence can strongly affect waiting times under a mixed-fleet operation. Indeed, with an optimal dispatching sequence, a more accurate adjustment of supply to demand is possible in accordance with time-dependent demand conditions, and the total savings in waiting time are mainly driven by a further reduction in the number of passengers left behind. The optimality of uneven dispatching headways stems from two elements: having a mixed fleet and having localized peaks on demand that make buses run full.},

In view of the highly dispersed and regular passenger flow, demand responsive transit is an important complementary means for traditional public transport to improve passenger satisfaction. However, high operating costs and low load factor will have a bad impact on the operation of public transport and reduce passenger satisfaction. In this work, firstly, by analyzing the demand frequency of historical travel stations, the stations with high demand are extracted by time periods as high probability travel points; On this basis, a dynamic vehicle dispatching optimization model is established, and the static vehicle dispatching is carried out with the goal of minimizing the running mileage of the bus system; Finally, based on the initial static route and the later real-time travel demand, the accurate dynamic planning algorithm is used to optimize the dynamic route with the goal of minimizing the change of the system mileage, so as to achieve timely response to the demand. The results show that the two-phase scheduling optimization model based on the station extraction strategy can provide a reasonable real-time vehicle scheduling and route optimization scheme, improve the utilization rate of vehicles and the passenger load factor, and provide a theoretical basis and application guidance for actual vehicle scheduling.},

The proposed methodology is characterized by service time windows and selected metro schedules when passengers place a personalized travel order. In addition, synchronous transfers between shuttles and feeder buses were fully considered regarding transit problems. Aiming at optimizing the total travel time of passengers, a mixed-integer linear programming model was established, which includes vehicle ride time from pickup locations to drop-off locations and passenger wait time during transfer travels. Since this model is commonly known as an NP-hard problem, a new two-stage heuristic using the ant colony algorithm (ACO) was developed in this study to efficiently achieve the meta-optimal solution of the model within a reasonable time. Furthermore, a case study in Chongqing, China, shows that compared with conventional models, the developed model was more efficient formaking passenger, route and operation plans, and it could reduce the total travel time of passengers.},

With the increased usage of automatic vehicle location (AVL) and automatic passenger counting (APC) systems, it is possible to construct the statistical distributions of passenger demand and travel time by time of day. This can give rise to improve the accuracy of the frequencies determined. This study presents a new approach of frequency setting by enabling the use of stochastic properties of the collected data and its associated costs within a supply chain optimization model. An optimization framework is constructed based on two main cost elements: (a) empty-seat driven (unproductive cost) and (b) overload and un-served demand (increased user cost). The objective function is to minimize the total cost incurred with decision variables of either frequency or vehicle capacity (vehicle size). That is, from the operator perspective it is desirable to utilize efficiently the fleet of vehicles which is related to the decisions of the vehicle size. From the authority perspective, the concern is to provide an adequate level of service in terms of frequency.

The bus dispatching problem is formulated as a stochastic decision process. The optimality equations are derived and the optimal holding policy is found by backward induction. A control method that requires much less information and that closely approximates the optimal dispatching policy is found. A simulation assuming stochastic operating conditions and unstable headway dynamics is performed to assess the expected average waiting time of passengers at stations.

Determining the dispatching headways of bus services in a city network is a multi-criteria problem that typically involves balancing between passenger demand coverage and operational costs. In this study, the problem of setting the optimal dispatching headways is formulated with the explicit consideration of operational variability issues for mitigating the adverse effects of passenger demand and travel time variations inherent to bus operations. The proposed model for setting the dispatching headways of bus lines considers the demand, headway and travel time variations along every section of each bus route for different times of the day, as well as operational costs, vehicle capacity and fleet size constraints. We first formulate the problem while accounting for the consequences of variability in service operations. The resulting optimization problem is then solved by employing a Branch and Bound approach together with Sequential Quadratic Programming in order to find the optimal dispatching headway for each bus line. Experimental results demonstrate (a) the improvement potential of the base case dispatching headways when considering the service reliability; (b) the sensitivity of the determined dispatching headways to changes in different criteria, such as passenger demand and/or bus running costs, and (c) the convergence accuracy of the proposed solution method when compared to heuristic approaches.},

First, with explicit consideration of differences in driving range, recharging duration and energy consumption of EBs for multiple vehicle types, an optimization model is established to minimize annual total scheduling costs, including the purchase costs of EBs and chargers, the operating costs of deadheading and timetabled trips, etc. Then, a heuristic procedure is developed to find the optimal solution considering recharging trips and the substitution between electric vehicle (EV) types. Finally, the proposed methodology is validated using a real-world transit network in Daxing District, Beijing. The optimization result provides transit agencies with guidance on the purchase and schedule of EBs for multiple vehicle types, as well as the deployment of chargers. Comparative analysis indicates the proposed method considering the substitution between EV types reduces annual total scheduling costs by 15.93% compared with the conventional method.

This system occupies an intermediate position between route systems and taxi services and ensures flexibility in providing on-demand transport services. The article describes the main technologies that can be used in the DRT system, including those with fixed routes (Flexible-Route Segments, Request Stops) and without fixed routes (Demand-Responsive Connector, Feeder Service, Zone Route, Point Deviation). Despite the wide international experience in implementing DRT in practice, there are no clear criteria to determine the conditions, under which it is reasonable to introduce a particular technology of flexible service for passengers. The article systematizes the factors that determine the feasibility of transferring a bus route to the DRT system in particular time intervals and also determines a sequence of actions for the introduction of flexible modes of public transport services. The considered technologies to manage public transportation on demand show that it is possible to combine regular traffic and demand-responsive service, using these modes at different times. Such an approach allows reducing the carrier's costs while maintaining or even improving the quality of public transportation compared with systems implementing only flexible service modes.},

   abstract = {Existing peak/off-peak based schedules in urban mass transit systems feature two types of dispatch headways and a fixed vehicle capacity across the operational horizon, which lowers their service quality and causes significant energy waste. A promising cure to this challenge is to jointly design the dispatch headways and vehicle capacities in urban transit schedules. Chen et al. (2018) propose a continuous modeling method to solve the near-optimum solutions to and shed analytical insights into this joint design problem. Based on the theoretical properties discovered in the preceding paper, this paper formulates the joint design problem as a mixed integer linear programming model that can yield exact solutions to the optimal design with a discretized time representation. Further, a customized DP algorithm is proposed to solve this model. Similar to other problems that can be solved by DP algorithms, the “curse of dimensionality” also exists in the investigated problem since the queue length, as a state variable, may have a large set of possible values at each stage, which may lead to dramatically increasing computational time in solving the problem. To expedite the solution speed of the DP algorithm, we propose a set of valid inequalities based on the relationship between the queue length and vehicle capacity. These valid inequalities can reduce the unboundedly increasing state space into a narrow band and thus dramatically expedite the DP algorithm. With two sets of numerical experiments, we show that the discrete model can be solved by the customized DP algorithm to optimality with much less computation time compared with a state-of-the-art commercial solver, Gurobi. The analysis also reveals that the input parameters affect the effectiveness of dynamic capacity design under oversaturated and unsaturated traffic systems in a similar way despite some minor differences.},

   abstract = {This paper examines the time-dependent bus dispatching problem in a multi-modal context. Traditional studies along this line often optimize the bus frequency or schedule. However, they may fail as the realized bus frequency or schedule is constrained by the time-varying traffic congestion on the road. Adding more buses to service does not necessarily increase the service frequency. Given this, we look into the time-dependent bus dispatching (number of buses in service on road) when taking into account complex multimodal and multi-directional flow interactions on the road. In particular, the traffic dynamics over clock time is modeled through an aggregate traffic representation with flow interactions between cars and buses, and interactions between traffic in opposite moving directions. Instead of explicitly optimizing the size of dispatched bus fleet, we propose an adaptive fleet size adjustment mechanism where we have a target level of bus loading factor. This adaptive or responsive approach, by taking advantage of the doubly dynamical system proposed in Liu and Geroliminis (2017), adjusts the size of dispatched bus fleet over calendar time and accommodates day-to-day variations of mode choices and traffic patterns. Numerical studies show that the proposed approach can help bus operator to reduce operating cost and improve net benefit while maintaining comparable user costs for passengers. This study offers a new perspective for dynamic bus dispatching strategy and improves our understanding of multi-modal traffic dynamics.},

   abstract = {This paper describes a coordinated four-stage interactive graphic process for operational transit planning. Stage 1 deals with route, headway, and vehicle-type optimization; stage 2 attempts to optimize transfer delays; stage 3 designs runs so that the service resulting from the previous stages can be oporetionalized; and stage 4 provides computer assistance in making manpower assignments. The network optimization procedure of stage 1 has been previously reported on, and the latter two stages aro currently under development. This paper deals principally with the trans· fer optimization tool of stage 2. The operational tool to optimize trans· fer delays involves the automated-iterative modification of terminal de· parture times. An interactive graphic computer approach is used to in· crease the transparency of the tool to the planner. The analysis takes Into account the calculation of expected waiting times for transfers be· tween transit lines with different headways and the interdependence of terminal departure times. Within the interactive graphic optimization process. the user can request computer-generated and com1>uter-drawn charts of transfer movements and delays, time-distance diagrams of in· dividual routes, and computer-produced transfer statistics at individual stops as well as the entire system. The process has been applied to the Basel Transit System in Switzerland, which serves a population of 500 000. In comparison with the existing hand-generated timetable, the optimized timetable reduces the total transfer delays by approximately 20 percent with no increase in operating costs.},

   abstract = {Urban bus companies have collected a tremendous amount of travel data from passengers in the past years. In spite of great value for bus schedule optimization, these data have not been fully exploited. In this paper, we leverage hundreds of millions of bus transaction records, generated when passengers board and alight, to infer time-dependent traffic and customer demand. When the traffic and demand information are available, we build an optimal model to schedule the departure time of each bus service with the objective of minimizing the average waiting time. Experimental results show that compared with the existing bus scheduling system, our model can help reduce the waiting time by a wide margin.},

The minimum of total cost of passenger travel time and bus company operation is taken as the optimization objective, departure intervals and vehicle types are taken as the optimization variables. The impact of route overlap on passenger travel time is analyzed. A heuristic algorithm is developed to solve the optimization model to produce the departure time and vehicle type for each bus trip. Finally, three real bus routes in Harbin city are taken as an example to validate the proposed model using peak-hour data. Compared with the model without considering route overlap, the proposed model can reduce total passenger travel time and cost by 5.2% and 8.8% respectively.},

   abstract = {The public bus transit system of Bangkok is one of the largest in the world and operates in a very hectic traffic environment. The development of a specific and computerized trip frequency scheduling mechanism is required to provide good service at minimal cost. Trip frequency scheduling is studied taking into account the present practices, limited bus fleet size, lack of parking spaces, the fluctuating traffic conditions throughout the day, and the special feature that buses and crews are not pre-assigned to specific trips by the beginning of the daily operation. An integer programming model is developed and two heuristic methods, one of which is based on linear programming and the other being a straightforward derivation of common bus operation practice, are presented. The resulting methodology is tested on two selected bus routes in Bangkok and extensive comparisons are made. In this case study, it appears that schedules can be designed which simultaneously reduce exploitation costs and improve service to the public. The methodology allows the bus company to systematically plan all its bus frequencies and to allocate buses to routes in a much more efficient way than at present.},

Despite its importance, there are serious challenges associated with producing reliable and high quality forecasts — especially when there are a variety of time series and analysts with expertise in time series modeling are relatively rare. To address these challenges, we describe a practical approach to forecasting “at scale” that combines configurable models with analyst-in-the-loop performance analysis. We propose a modular regression model with interpretable parameters that can be intuitively adjusted by analysts with domain knowledge about the time series. We describe performance analyses to compare and evaluate forecasting procedures, and automatically flag forecasts for manual review and adjustment. Tools that help analysts to use their expertise most effectively enable reliable, practical forecasting of business time series.</p>},

   abstract = {Because of their effectiveness in broad practical applications, LSTM networks have received a wealth of coverage in scientific journals, technical blogs, and implementation guides. However, in most articles, the inference formulas for the LSTM network and its parent, RNN, are stated axiomatically, while the training formulas are omitted altogether. In addition, the technique of “unrolling” an RNN is routinely presented without justification throughout the literature. The goal of this tutorial is to explain the essential RNN and LSTM fundamentals in a single document. Drawing from concepts in Signal Processing, we formally derive the canonical RNN formulation from differential equations. We then propose and prove a precise statement, which yields the RNN unrolling technique. We also review the difficulties with training the standard RNN and address them by transforming the RNN into the “Vanilla LSTM”1 1The nickname “Vanilla LSTM” symbolizes this model’s flexibility and generality (Greff et al., 2015). network through a series of logical arguments. We provide all equations pertaining to the LSTM system together with detailed descriptions of its constituent entities. Albeit unconventional, our choice of notation and the method for presenting the LSTM system emphasizes ease of understanding. As part of the analysis, we identify new opportunities to enrich the LSTM system and incorporate these extensions into the Vanilla LSTM network, producing the most general LSTM variant to date. The target reader has already been exposed to RNNs and LSTM networks through numerous available resources and is open to an alternative pedagogical approach. A Machine Learning practitioner seeking guidance for implementing our new augmented LSTM model in software for experimentation and research will find the insights and derivations in this treatise valuable as well.},

This paper proposes an interactive multiple model (IMM) filter algorithm-based model to predict short-term passenger demand. After aggregated in 15 min interval, passenger demand data collected from a busy bus route over four months were used to generate time series. Considering that passenger demand exhibits various characteristics in different time scales, three time series were developed, named weekly, daily, and 15 min time series. After the correlation, periodicity, and stationarity analyses, time series models were constructed. Particularly, the heteroscedasticity of time series was explored to achieve better prediction performance. Finally, IMM filter algorithm was applied to combine individual forecasting models with dynamically predicted passenger demand for next interval. Different error indices were adopted for the analyses of individual and hybrid models. The performance comparison indicates that hybrid model forecasts are superior to individual ones in accuracy. Findings of this study are of theoretical and practical significance in bus scheduling.},

   abstract = {Passenger travel flows of urban rail transit during holidays usually show distinct characteristics different from normal days. To ensure efficient operation management, it is essential to accurately predict the distribution of holiday passenger flow. Based on Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) data, this paper explores the passengers' destination choice differences between normal days and holidays, as well as one-way tickets and public transportation cards, which provides support for variable selection in modeling. Then, a forecasting model of holiday travel distribution is proposed, in which the destination choice model is established for representing local and nonlocal passengers. Meanwhile, explanatory variables such as land matching degree, scenic spot dummy, and level of service variables are introduced to deal with the particularity of holiday passengers' travel behavior. The parameters calibrated by the improved weighted exogenous sampling maximum likelihood (WESML) method are applied to predict passenger flow distribution in different holiday cases with annual changes in the metro network, using the data collected from Guangzhou Metro, China. The results show that the proposed model is valid and performs better than the other comparable models in terms of forecasting accuracy. The proposed model has the capability to provide a more universal and accurate passenger flow distribution prediction method for urban rail transit in different holiday scenarios with network changes.},

   abstract = {The mobility of modern metropolises strongly relies on urban rail transit (URT) systems, and such a heavy dependence causes that even minor service interruptions would make the URT systems unsustainable. This study aims at optimally dispatching the ground feeder-bus to coordinate with the urban rails' operation for eliminating the effect of unexpected service interruptions in URT corridors. A feeder-bus dispatch planning model was proposed for the collaborative optimization of URT and feeder-bus cooperation under emergency situations and minimizing the total evacuation cost of the feeder-buses. To solve the model, a concept of dummy feeder-bus system is proposed to transform the nonlinear model into traditional linear programming (ILP) model, i.e., traditional transportation problem. The case study of Line #2 of Nanjing URT in China was adopted to illustrate the model application and sensitivity analyses of the key variables. The modeling results show that as the evacuation time window increases, the total evacuation cost as well as the number of dispatched feeder-buses decrease, and the dispatched feeder-buses need operate for more times along the feeder-bus line. The number of dispatched feeder-buses does not show an obvious change with the increase of parking spot capacity and time window, indicating that simply increasing the parking spot capacity would cause huge waste for the emergent bus utilization. When the unbalanced evacuation demand exists between stations, the more feeder-buses are needed. The method of this study will contribute to improving transportation emergency management and resource allocation for URT systems.},
